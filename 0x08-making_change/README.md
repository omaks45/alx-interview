A task in finding the minimum number of endless list of coins
that give a certain total number
steps:
1. Checks if the total is 0 and returns 0.
2. sort the coins in descending order
3. create an instance of the minimum number to 0
4. Iterate through the list of coins
5. Checks if the total is 0 or less then break
6. assign a container to the total
7. instance of the minimum value will equate the total container
8. total in descending order equals the total container times the each coin
9. out of the loop check if the total is not 0
10. return -1
11. return the minimum value
