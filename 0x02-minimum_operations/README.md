Using a recursive method :

n =  the total number of the text in the file.
x = the smallest prime factor of n.
y = half the size of n.

We'd say n = x * y.
if n is a prime number, i.e number divisible by 1 and itself we will have to copy
the singular H and paste it as n - 1 times giving us n total number of operations
