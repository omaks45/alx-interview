Start processing the integers in the given list one by one.
For every integer, obtain the binary representation in the string format. Since integers can be very large, we should only keep/consider the 8 least significant bits of data and discard the rest as mentioned in the problem statement. After this step, you should have 8-bits or 1-byte string representation for the integer. Let the string we get here be called bin_form.
There are two scenarios that we need to consider here in the next step.
One is that we are in the middle of processing some UTF-8 encoded character. In this case we simply need to check the first two bits of the string and see if they are 10 i.e. the 2 most significant bits of the integer being 1 and 0. bin_form[:2] == "10"
The other case is that we already processed some valid UTF-8 characters and we have to start processing a new UTF-8 character. In that case we have to look at a prefix of the string representation and look at the number of 1s that we encounter before encountering a 0. This will tell us the size of the next UTF-8 character.
